# store-api
Adding sorting/limiting/numericFilters for the api 

We only have two routes here 
#Static one with controller method as getAllProductsStatic
#Dynamic one with getAllProducts 

We are not using POST,PUT or Delete methods here because we are soley focussing on query based search.
We applied sort, limit, numericFilters.

This project doesnt have any front end as well, I mainly used post man to test it.

Note:-
Add a .env file with your mongoDB account link as a parameter in it for this project to run because iam removing .env file.
run npm install inorder to install all the node modules for the project to run.
